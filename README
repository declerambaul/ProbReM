ProbReM (PROBabilistic RElational Model)


INSTALLATION

It is likely that you have received the Probrem package in form of a zip file.
There is no installation, the unziped folder ./Probrem is all that is needed.
See PACKAGES for information about additional packages that are required.

This folder is actually a GIT repository as there is a hidden folder '.git'.
GIT is a control versioning system. Besides all the other advantages of using 
a cvs, it also serves as a natural way to backup my data. I work on a local 
repository on my laptop and commit/push all the changes to a remote repository 
on my McGill account.

FROM PROJECT FILES ONLY (NO GIT REPOSITORY)
Set up a remote reposity
$ ssh 'user'@ubuntu.cs.mcgill.ca
$ mkdir 'projectpath'
$ cd 'projectpath'
$ mv 'pathtodownload'/Probrem/ .
$ git init
$ git add ./Probrem (where Probrem contains all project files)
$ git commit -a -m 'first commit, adding project files'
Setting up a local reposity
$ git clone ssh://'user'@ubuntu.cs.mcgill.ca/home/2008/'user'/Probrem.git
After setting up the local and remote repositories, one can simply do
$ git commit -a -m "commit comment"

$ git push 
to commit to the remote repository on my mcgill account
