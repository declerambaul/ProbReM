Extensions
================

What follows in an incomplete and brief list of features that are currently being implemented. 

* At the moment it necessary that the world is fixed, e.g. the relational structure is given. We are currently implementing a novel method for making inference in domains with `reference uncertainty`. This is unpublished work.

* An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for missing data and latent variables.

* Support for continuos variables

* Parametric distributions (e.g. Normal, Beta distributions)

* Universal prior distributions in conjunction with parametric distributions
