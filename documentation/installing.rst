.. _installing_Probrem:

Installation
----------------------------

It is hard to draw a line between the core functionality of the framework and the functionality needed by a specific |probrem| project. For this reason the source code will be provided as a folder and the framework has to be added to the `PYTHONPATH` of the |probrem| project. 

In the next release, |probrem| will be provided as a Github repository and can be installed on the system. In the meantime, the source code is provided as `tar file <http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Patient>`_ . Installing |probrem| is straight forward, just copy the tar file to your favourite folder and   ::

    tar -xvzf probrem.tar.gz
    
See :ref:`Using ProbReM<using_probrem>` for how to start a new project.
