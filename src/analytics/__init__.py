The analytics package :mod:`!analytics` implements methods that can be used to analyse/configure/debug the code and the model.

* Measure the running time of any method, e.g. how much time is spent executing individual methods
* Display graphs, e.g. the Ground Bayesian Network, using either `GraphViz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ or `NetworkX <http://networkx.lanl.gov/>`_ - both of which have to be installed seperately.
