The Ground Bayes Network (GBN) in ProbReM is the smallest subset of data that is required to answer a specific query. While the PRM uses a first-order representation of the world, the inference process needs a propositional represenation of the data. The :mod:`network.groundBN` module implements an efficient data structure for that purpose.
